      When the repository is initailzed, it creates .git file. By doing this, we can create git repository
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
      Working directory contains all files including the files which are commited and also  not commited. Whereas repository
      contains the files which are commited to the repository. Staging area contains files which can be commited to the
      repository
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
      by using "git diff --staged"
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
